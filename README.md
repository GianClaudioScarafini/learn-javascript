## js-scope

what is a scope in js?
A scope is a space or environment where variables and functions are declared.

There are two types of scope in JavaScript:
1. Local scope
2. Global scope

JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.

Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

Local JavaScript Variables
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.
